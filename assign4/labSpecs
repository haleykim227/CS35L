Specs Summary

- lab4.txt == lab notebook, record everything
- maintaining an old version of coreutils, bug in the ls program
- bug: ls -t mishandles very old timestamps, considers them future files
- build the old version as-is
- build it again with a patch
- what problems while building as-is?
- why did the renaming patch fix it?
- reproduce the problem
- use a debugger to figure out what went wrong
- fix the corresponding source file
- construct new patch file lab4.diff containing coreutil files in form of ChangeLog entry followed by diff -u patch
- try and reproduce the problem on a seasnet directory, not tmp
- run test case using already installed touch and ls instead of old coreutils -- how well does seasnet do?
