- Answer questions:
  	 Q3. What happens when this script is invoked on an empty file like /dev/null, and why?

	 Q4. What happens when this script is invoked with Python 3 rather than Python 2, and why?

- write a new script shuf.py in the style of randline.py but using Python 3 instead

  	script should implement <bold>shuf </bold>command

- you want a python version of <bold>shuf

</bold>- should support options including:

  	should support --input-range (-i), --head-count (-n), --repeat (-r), and --help

	if --repeat (-r) is used without --head-count (-n), your program should run forever

	should support zero non-option arguments or a single non-option argument "-"

	should support single non-option argument other than "-"

	need not support the other options of GNU shuf

	should report an error if given invalid arguments

- your shuf.py program should not import any modules other than argparse, string and the modules that randline.py already imports

- change its usage message to accurately describe the modified behavior

- Answer question:

  	 Q5. What happens when your shuf.py script is invoked with Python 2 rather than Python 3, and why?
