1.

I ran "cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs-CS-35L"
Then I ran "du -sh" on the directory, which gave me the disk usage of this directory in a quantifiable number. The result was 509MB.
Then I ran "du -sh .git" to do the same thing but only for the .git/ directory. The result was 350MB.
The files that comsumed most of the repository space were .git/objects/pack(335M), .git/objects(342MB), and .git(350M) itself. These files consume the most space because the objects are copied across when a repository is cloned, and the object files require a large amount of space.

2.

To find local branches, I ran "git branch | wc -l", "git branch" being the command to figure out all the local branches, and pipelining that output to "wc -l" to count the number of lines, since the result is one branch per line. This gave me 176.
To find remote branches, I ran "git branch -r | wc -l", "git branch -r" being the command to figure out all the remote branches, and using the same pipeline for line count. This gave me 177.

3.

I ran "git remote -v" to list all the remote repositories and their links, which gave me the output:

	origin	https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git (fetch)
	origin	https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git (push)

4. 

I ran "git for-each-ref --sort=-committerdate refs/heads/ --format='%(committerdate:short) %(refname:short)'".

These are the 10 local branches most recently committed to.

5.

Ran "git status" to see where the HEAD is, said I was on branch master. Then ran "git rev-list --count HEAD" to find out how many commits there are in this branch. 139583 commits.

6.

Ran "git rev-list --all --count" to see the number of commits regardless of branch. There are 143910 total commits. 139583 out of 143910 total commits are in the master branch. 96.99% of all commits are also in the master branch.

7. 

I ran "git shortlog -s -n --since=01.01.2013".

  3691  Eli Zaretskii
  3644  Glenn Morris
  3604  Paul Eggert
  1806  Lars Ingebrigtsen
  1784  Stefan Monnier
  1571  Michael Albinus
   619  Dmitry Gutov
   576  Noam Postavsky
   471  Alan Mackenzie
   469  Juri Linkov

These ten people authored the most master-branch commits since the year 2013 or later, and the numbers in front of the names indicate how many commits each of them made.
